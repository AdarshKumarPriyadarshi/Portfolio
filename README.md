Welcome! This is my personal portfolio website built to showcase my projects, skills, and professional background.

## 💡 About Me

I am a software engineer student and developer with interests in full-stack development, machine learning, and building practical applications — especially in domains like hotel & food management, cargo-ship management systems, and recommendation engines.  
I also work with technologies like Flask, Java, Python, and JavaScript to build meaningful applications and solutions.  

Feel free to explore my work and reach out if you’d like to collaborate or connect!

## 🧰 Tech Stack & Tools

My portfolio is built using:

- Modern frontend tooling (HTML, CSS / Tailwind, JavaScript / TypeScript)  
- Build tooling and package management (e.g. via `npm` / `package.json`)  
- Configuration using `tsconfig`, bundling setup (e.g. via Vite or similar)  
- Containerization / deployment configs (e.g. `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yaml`)  

*(You may update this list based on exactly what’s in your repo — e.g. frameworks, build tools, etc.)*
